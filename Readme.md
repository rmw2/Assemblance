# Digestible Assembly
Learning an assembly language is very helpful for understanding machine operations at a low level, and knowing the ways that that machine translates expressive lines of C source (for example) into individual instructions can help one write more efficient code.
Unfortunately, most tools dedicated to compilers and assembly languages are geared towards experts, and there are relatively few resources available to those trying to learn assembly from scratch.

The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive, browser-based explorer for C90 and x86-64 that illustrates the relationships between source and assembly and provides easy access to information about different assembly mnemonics and registers.
A similar project developed by Matt Godbolt can be found at http://gcc.godbolt.com -- this appears to focus more on comparing the assembly generated by different compilers, while this tool is aimed more at teaching assembly language patterns and concepts to those unfamiliar.

Special thanks to Bob Dondero for his advising during this project, and the x86-64 resources he developed for Princeton's COS217: Systems Programming.
